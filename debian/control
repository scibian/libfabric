Description: Development files for the libfabric library
 Libfabric is a core component of OFI. It is the library that defines and
 exports the user-space API of OFI, and is typically the only software that
 applications deal with directly. It works in conjunction with provider
 libraries, which are often integrated directly into libfabric.

Description: User-space RDMA Fabric Interfaces
 OpenFabrics Interfaces (OFI) is a framework focused on exporting fabric
 communication services to applications. OFI is best described as a collection
 of libraries and applications used to export fabric services. The key
 components of OFI are: application interfaces, provider libraries, kernel
 services, daemons, and test applications.
